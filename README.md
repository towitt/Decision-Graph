# Decision-Graph

Decision graphs are an extension of decision trees originally proposed by [Oliver, Dowe and Wallace (1992)](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.52.1476&rep=rep1&type=pdf). This repository provides the implementation of a decision graph algorithm for the data analytics platform KNIME. Details are described [here](DecisionGraphs.pdf).
